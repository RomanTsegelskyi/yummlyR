R package with bindings for [Yummly API](developer.yummly.com)

NOTE: Neither this package or its author is affiliated Yummly.

Installation
============

Since package has not yet been release to CRAN, you can get it by running

```
devtools::intstall_github("RomanTsegelskyi/yummlyr")
```

Usage
=====

First of all, obtain an API credentials from [Yummly.com](https://developer.yummly.com/).

After that you can use `save_yummly_credentials` to presist the `application ID` and `application key` between querries, or supply the directly to `search_recipes` and `get_recipe` functions.

Search Recipes
--------------

`search_recipes` function corresponds to [Search Recipes API call](https://developer.yummly.com/documentation#) and is used to search for recipes fitting certain criterias. [Example search response](https://developer.yummly.com/wiki/search-recipes-response-sample). Simplest call looks like this:

```
search_recipes('bacon')
```

YummlyR supports wide variety of criterias:

* `require_pictures` set to TRUE if only to return recipes with photos
* `allowed_ingredient` ingredient that all search results must include
* `excluded_ingredient` ingredient that all search results should not contain
* `allowed_diet` search results will only include recipes whose ingredients are allowed for that diet
* `allowed_allergy` only include recipes whose ingredients are allowed for that allergy
* `allowed_cuisine` search results will only include recipes with that cuisine
* `excluded_cuisine` search results will only exclude recipes with that cuisine
* `allowed_course` search results will only include recipes with that cuisine
* `excluded_course` search results will only exclude recipes with that cuisine
* `excluded_holiday` search results will only exclude recipes with that holiday
* `max_total_time` search for recipes that do not exceed a specified max total cook + prep time in seconds
* `max_results` number of results to return
* `start` start with specific result in search
* `nutrition` set the range of allowed values for a given nutrition attribute (see below for the list of supported nutrition attributes) by setting a min and/or a max
* `flavor` set the ranges for taste attributes (this corresponds to the taste sliders on the Yummly.com search page). The values of min and max are between 0 and 1.
* `facet_field` facet counts for ingredient and diet. When this parameter is called, the response will include a facetCounts object that lists the matching diets or ingredients and how many results match each diet or ingredient.

For example, 

```
search_recipes("onion soup", allowed_ingredient = "bacon")
```

will return onion soup recipes that have bacon as one of the ingredients. More detailed expanations of Yummly's Search API with example can be found [here](https://developer.yummly.com/documentation#).

**Note** that allowed values for `ingeredient`, `diet`, `allergy`, `cuisine`, `course`, `holiday`, `nutrition` and `flavor` are defined by [Yummly.com metadata](https://developer.yummly.com/documentation#Metadata) and saved inside the package for convenience. Available metadata can be accessed using `get_metadata` function, for example,

```
get_metadata('holiday')
```

will return you `data.frame` with information about available `holiday` keywords.


Get Recipe
-------

Fetch a recipe by its recipe ID. [Example recipe response](https://developer.yummly.com/wiki/get-recipe-response-sample). For example, 

```
get_recipe("French-Onion-Soup-The-Pioneer-Woman-Cooks-_-Ree-Drummond-41364")
```

returns a detailed information about [French Onion Soup
French Onion Soup](http://www.yummly.com/recipe/French-Onion-Soup-1332461).
